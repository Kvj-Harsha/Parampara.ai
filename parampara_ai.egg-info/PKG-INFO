# 🧠 Parampara AI  
**Bridging Tradition with Modern AI**  
[🌐 Live Demo → **parampara.streamlit.app**](https://parampara.streamlit.app)

> ⚠️ *Note: Open-source speech/translation models were considered and tested locally. However, due to the cost and complexity of deploying them, we used Google's Gemini API in the deployed version.*

---

## 📌 Overview

**Parampara AI** is a Streamlit-based platform designed to help preserve oral and cultural traditions. It enables **knowledge keepers, artisans, and storytellers**—especially from rural and indigenous communities—to digitize their spoken narratives and craft knowledge.

Using **Google's Gemini AI**, it transcribes, translates, and summarizes audio inputs (in Indian languages like **Telugu**) into structured, accessible digital formats.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🎙️ **Transcribe & Translate**  
  Converts spoken audio in regional languages like Telugu to English text.

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Summarization**  
  Generates structured, step-by-step instructions or narrative summaries.

- 🌍 **Metadata Enrichment**  
  Captures contextual info: speaker name, location, and category.

- 📁 **Collection View**  
  Easily browse past uploads with access to audio, transcript, translation, and summaries.

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/parampara-ai.git
cd parampara-ai
```

2. **Install Requirements**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set Up API Key**

Create a `.env` file with your Google Gemini API key:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
```

4. **Run the App**

```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Dependencies

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Streamlit** – For interactive UI
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini)** – For transcription, translation, summarization
- **dotenv**, **Pillow**, **uuid**, etc.

## 🧪 Notes on Models & Hosting

🔍 **Open-Source Model Note**  
The project initially explored using **open-source speech-to-text and translation models**. While these models performed well locally during testing (offline and downloaded), **hosting them proved cost-prohibitive** for deployment. Therefore, for scalability and quick integration, **Google Gemini API** was used during deployment.

---

## 💡 Example Use Case

> 🎧 A 20-60 second or more audio clip of a Telugu-speaking artisan describing traditional pottery is uploaded.  
> Parampara AI:
> - Transcribes the Telugu audio.
> - Translates it into English.
> - Generates a clear, step-by-step tutorial for documentation and learning.
