  "translation_english": "Assalamu Alaikum bhai! Our lives are deeply connected to the earth, to clay. We learned this craft from our father, who in turn learned it from his father. Since childhood, we've watched them working on the potter's wheel. Now, we do it, and our children are learning too. First, we search for good quality, soft clay. Only then do good pots get made. We soak that clay in water and knead it thoroughly. We soften it with our hands so it can be worked on the wheel. Then, we place the clay on the potter's wheel.  We still use a wheel operated by hand or foot. Some people use motorized ones, but we prefer the traditional way. As the wheel turns, we slowly shape the clay. Be it a cup, a pot, or a rustic vase. Once the shape is ready, we keep the pot to dry.  After it dries well in the sun, we bake it in the fire.  This requires great care. We use wood, trash, or coconut shells to make the fire and bake the pots. Only then does it become useful and waterproof. Some people paint or glaze them, but we prefer the traditional method – the natural color and the earthy fragrance. That's the true beauty.  This work has become less common today. People are forgetting it. But we still do it wholeheartedly.  Because it is not just a skill, it's our identity. Our land, our clay—this is our story.\n\n\n**Summary JSON:**",
