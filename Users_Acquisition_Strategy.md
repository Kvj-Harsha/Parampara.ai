## User Acquisition Strategy: Parampara AI

### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this user acquisition strategy is to drive initial adoption of the Parampara AI platform during a focused two-week campaign (Weeks 3-4 of the project). The goals are twofold:

- Acquire a critical mass of early users to validate the platform's utility and gather real-world feedback.
- Build a foundational, diverse corpus of oral traditions by collecting a significant number of high-quality audio contributions from across India.

### 2. Target Audience Personas
We have identified two key user personas to target during this initial phase.

### 4. Promotional Material Templates

#### Email Template for Academics
**Subject:** A New, Free Tool for Preserving Oral Traditions - Parampara AI

Dear Professor [Last Name],

My name is [Your Name], and I am part of the team behind Parampara AI, a new platform dedicated to documenting and preserving India's rich oral traditions using AI.

We have developed a simple tool that allows anyone to upload an audio clip in an Indic language, and our AI will automatically transcribe, translate, and summarize it. We believe this could be an invaluable resource for students and researchers in your department for fieldwork, data collection, and classroom projects.

The platform is completely free to use. You can explore it here: [Link to App]

Would you be open to sharing this with your students and colleagues who might find it useful?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
The Parampara AI Team

#### Social Media / Community Forum Post
**Headline:** Your Voice, Our Heritage. Help us build India's oral tradition archive!

Hello everyone!

We're a small team passionate about preserving the incredible diversity of India's stories, poems, and languages. Many of these exist only in oral form and are at risk of being lost.

So, we built Parampara AI: a free tool where you can record a 30-second audio clip in your mother tongue, and our AI will help document it forever.

We need your help to build this archive. Please consider contributing a story, a proverb, or even a simple recipe!

### 5. Success Metrics & Measurement

#### Primary Metrics (Targets)
- Unique Users Acquired: 180
- Corpus Units Collected: 350

#### Secondary Metrics
- User Engagement Rate: Percentage of users who contribute after visiting the site.
- Linguistic Diversity: Number of distinct languages represented in the corpus.
- Qualitative Feedback: Collection of user suggestions and pain points via a simple, optional feedback form.

### 6. Contingency Plan
- **If Academic Outreach is Slow:** Pivot to direct-to-student channels and paid social media ads targeting interests like "linguistics" or "Indian history".
